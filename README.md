## ðŸ”§ Engine Stack

IonEngine is built using a robust stack of technologies:

- **C++** â€“ The backbone of both the runtime engine and the editor, delivering high performance and control.
- **Lua** â€“ A lightweight, fast scripting language used for writing game logic.
- **GLM** â€“ OpenGL Mathematics library used for vector and matrix math, essential for transforms, physics, and rendering.
- **LuaBridge** â€“ A lightweight library that binds C++ functions and classes to Lua, making scripting seamless and intuitive.
- **SDL** â€“ Cross-platform library for windowing, input, audio, and OpenGL context management.
- **Box2D** â€“ Industry-standard 2D physics engine that handles rigid body dynamics and collisions.
- **Dear ImGui** â€“ Immediate mode GUI used to build IonEngineâ€™s custom in-editor interface.
- **RapidJSON** â€“ High-performance JSON parser/generator used for saving scenes and game data.
